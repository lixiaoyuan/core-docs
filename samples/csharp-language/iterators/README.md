C# Iterators Sample
================

This sample is created during the [Iterators topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/csharp/iterators)
for learning C# features. Please see that topic for detailed steps on the code
for this sample.

Key Features
------------

This sample demonstrates iterating across a data source, and creating
iterator methods to control how a data source is visited (or iterated).
